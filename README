WARNING:
 THIS IS A STRIPPED COPY OF GN-SZP, ONLY MEANT AS A SHOWCASE.
 IT IS FROZEN ON A DEVELOPMENT COMMIT BEFORE ANY FUNCTIONALITY WAS FULLY ADDED.

 This repository will be updated soon with a more up-to-date version once it is
 further cleaned up and anonymized.


gn-szp
------
gn-szp is a partial replacement for Project-ZS NG (pzs-ng) in Go.

A note on performance:
 While writing this, several individuals came up to me and said that I shouldn't
 be writing performance-critical code in a garbage-collected language, and that
 this was a futile effort, as I'd face an uphill battle with regards to slowdowns
 not only by the gc, but because of the "abstraction from the hardware", and that
 I should write this in Rust, C++, or even C.

 Boy, were they wrong.. or, at least, partially.
 By default, gn-szp does some relatively stupid things to achieve its performance,
 such as disabling the garbage collector, but also does some really smart compiler
 hacks that allow us to have "constexpr"-level performance for config slices.

 Regardless, I'm glad to say that I've achieved my goal, and gn-szp is orders of
 magnitude faster than pzs-ng, especially in IO-intensive operations, thanks to
 Go's goroutine threading model; Please read performance.txt for more on this.

Key differences from pzs-ng:
 - gn-szp was written with only glftpd in mind, and as such does not feature
   a ftpd-agnostic mode.

Features:
 - nothing yet, lol.
